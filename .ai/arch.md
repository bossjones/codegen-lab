## Implementation Details

### 1. MCP Server Implementation

```python
class FastMCP:
    def __init__(self,
        config: Optional[Config] = None,
        logger: Optional[Logger] = None):
        """Initialize FastMCP server with optional configuration."""

    async def add_tool(self,
        func: Callable,
        name: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        """Register a new tool with the server."""

    async def start(self) -> None:
        """Start the FastMCP server."""
```

### 2. Rule Engine Implementation

```python
class RuleEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rules: Dict[str, Rule] = {}
        self.validators: List[RuleValidator] = []

    async def process_rule(self, rule_id: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Result:
        """Process a rule with given context."""
        pass

    async def validate_rule(self, rule: Rule) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate a rule's structure and content."""
        pass
```

### 3. Test Framework Implementation

```python
class TestFramework:
    def __init__(self, config: TestConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.generators: List[TestGenerator] = []
        self.runners: List[TestRunner] = []

    async def generate_tests(self, source: str) -> List[TestCase]:
        """Generate test cases for given source code."""
        pass

    async def run_tests(self, tests: List[TestCase]) -> TestResults:
        """Execute test cases and return results."""
        pass
```

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**
   - Environment variable storage
   - Regular key rotation
   - Secure key storage integration

2. **Code Generation Safety**
   - Syntax validation
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Sandboxed execution
   - Rate limiting

3. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access
   - Audit logging
   - Session management
   - Secure communication

## Performance Considerations

### MVP Phase Requirements
- LLM Response Time: < 5 seconds average
- Memory Usage: < 512MB peak
- CPU Usage: < 50% during normal operation

### Future Phase Targets
- LLM Response Time: < 2 seconds average
- Memory Usage: < 256MB peak
- CPU Usage: < 30% during normal operation

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Local Development**

## Open Questions

1. How will we handle versioning of MCP protocol changes?
2. What metrics should we collect for performance monitoring?
3. How can we optimize LLM response times?
4. What's the strategy for handling breaking changes in dependencies?

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **LLM Integration Risks**
   - Risk: LLM API downtime or failures
   - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling, fallback mechanisms, and retry logic

2. **Performance Risks**
   - Risk: High latency in code generation and analysis
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize request batching, and set up performance monitoring

3. **Security Risks**
   - Risk: Exposure of sensitive code or data to LLMs
   - Mitigation: Implement strict data filtering, token validation, and access controls

4. **Dependency Risks**
   - Risk: Breaking changes in key dependencies
   - Mitigation: Pin dependency versions, implement comprehensive testing, maintain dependency update strategy

# Title: PRD for LLM Codegen Lab

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Status: Draft

## Intro

The LLM Codegen Lab project aims to build a comprehensive toolkit for AI-assisted code generation workflows. This project will provide developers with a powerful set of tools for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into their development process, focusing on test-driven development, code quality, and efficient workflow automation. The toolkit will streamline the interaction between developers, LLMs, and development tools while maintaining high standards for code quality and testing.

## Goals

- Create a robust framework for AI-assisted code generation that integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows
- Achieve 90% test coverage for core modules through comprehensive test-driven development
- Reduce development time by 40% through automated code generation and testing
- Ensure high code quality through automated review and testing processes
- Provide a seamless integration experience with Cursor IDE and other development tools

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Test coverage >= 90% for core modules
- Average response time for LLM interactions < 2 seconds
- Code quality score >= 8/10 based on established metrics
- Developer productivity improvement >= 40%
- Zero security vulnerabilities in generated code
- 100% compliance with Python type hints and documentation standards

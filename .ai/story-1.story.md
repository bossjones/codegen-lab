<status>draft</status>
<type>feature</type>
<priority>high</priority>

## Objective
Implement the core Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using FastMCP framework to establish the foundation for AI-assisted development.

## Background
The MCP server is a critical component that provides standardized communication between LLM clients and servers. It needs to be implemented first to enable the rest of the system's functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FastMCP server implementation with basic configuration
- [ ] Tool registration and execution system
- [ ] Resource management system
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Full test coverage for all components
- [ ] Documentation for server setup and usage

## Technical Details

### Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Set up project structure
   - [ ] Create necessary directories (src/codegen_lab/mcp)
   - [ ] Initialize __init__.py files
   - [ ] Set up test directory structure

2. [ ] Implement core FastMCP server
   - [ ] Create base server class with configuration
   - [ ] Implement server initialization
   - [ ] Add logging system
   - [ ] Add error handling

3. [ ] Implement tool management
   - [ ] Create tool registration system
   - [ ] Implement tool execution
   - [ ] Add tool validation

4. [ ] Implement resource management
   - [ ] Create resource manager class
   - [ ] Add resource loading and caching
   - [ ] Implement resource templates

5. [ ] Create test suite
   - [ ] Unit tests for server components
   - [ ] Integration tests for tool execution
   - [ ] Performance tests for basic operations

### Dependencies
- Python 3.12+
- FastMCP framework
- pytest for testing
- UV for package management

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for server operations
- Performance benchmarks for response times
- Security testing for API endpoints

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: FastMCP framework integration challenges
  Mitigation: Start with simple implementation, gradually add features
- Risk: Performance issues with multiple tools
  Mitigation: Implement proper resource management and caching

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements

## Notes
Initial implementation should focus on core functionality while maintaining extensibility for future features.

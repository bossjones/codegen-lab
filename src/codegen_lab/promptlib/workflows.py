"""Workflows for cursor rules.

This module contains workflow functions for executing cursor rule tasks, including:
- plan_and_execute_prompt_library_workflow: Execute a structured workflow for cursor rule generation
- execute_phase_1: Execute the first phase of the workflow
- execute_phase_2: Execute the second phase of the workflow
- execute_phase_3: Execute the third phase of the workflow
- execute_phase_4: Execute the fourth phase of the workflow
- execute_phase_5: Execute the fifth phase of the workflow

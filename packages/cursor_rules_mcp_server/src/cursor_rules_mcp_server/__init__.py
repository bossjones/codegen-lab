"""Cursor Rules MCP Server.

This module contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that helps users create
custom cursor rules for their repositories. The server analyzes repository structure
and provides guidance for creating and organizing cursor rules.

# Simplified Implementation Checklist (Proof of Concept)

## Phase 1: Basic MCP Server Setup ✅
- [x] Implement the SqliteDatabase class for storing rules and repository data
- [x] Set up server models using MCP protocol
- [x] Implement server initialization and main entry point
- [x] Add basic resource handlers (list_resources, read_resource)
- [x] Define prompt handlers (list_prompts, get_prompt)
- [x] Create basic tool handlers (list_tools, call_tool)

## Phase 2: Repository Analysis Features ✅
- [x] Implement repository structure analysis tool
- [x] Create rule suggestion engine based on repo analysis

## Phase 3: Rule Generation Tools ✅
- [x] Implement rule template generation
- [x] Add rule collection management

## Phase 4: POC Integration Features
- [ ] Implement minimal JSON-RPC communication
  - [ ] Add basic request/response handling
  - [ ] Support simple notification system
- [ ] Implement core resource handling
  - [ ] Support basic TextResourceContents
  - [ ] Add minimal tool calling with JSONSchema
- [ ] Add rule installation to .cursor/rules
- [ ] Create basic documentation resources

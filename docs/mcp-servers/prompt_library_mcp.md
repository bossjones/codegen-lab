Ok, here's a breakdown of the `plan_and_execute_prompt_library_workflow` tool's actions, step by step, based on the provided code:

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The tool receives repository information (`repo_description`, `main_languages`, `file_patterns`, `key_features`), the current `phase` of the workflow (defaulting to 1), and the `workflow_state`.
    *   If `workflow_state` is not provided or is invalid, it initializes a new workflow state. This state stores repository information, recommended/created/deployed rules, and workspace preparation status. It also immediately calls `prep_workspace()` and stores the result.

2.  **Phase Execution (Based on the `phase` input):**
    *   The tool uses a conditional structure (`if/elif/else`) to determine which phase of the workflow to execute.  Each `execute_phase_X` function encapsulates the logic for a specific phase.

3.  **`execute_phase_1` (Repository Analysis):**
    *   **Workspace Check:**  Verifies if the workspace is prepared (`workflow_state.get("workspace_prepared")`). If not, it calls `prep_workspace()` to set up directories and updates the workflow state.
    *   **Repo Analysis Prompt:** Calls `repo_analysis_prompt` with repository information to get an analysis and rule suggestions.
    *   **Results Processing:** Parses the analysis results from `repo_analysis_prompt`'s output into a structured format, extracting repository type, common patterns, and recommended rules.
    *   **State Update:** Updates the `workflow_state` with the analysis results and marks `phase_1_complete` as `True`.

4.  **`execute_phase_2` (Rule Identification):**
    *   **Prerequisites Check:** Checks if Phase 1 is complete.
    *   **Repository Summary Creation:** Creates a summary string from repository information to be used by the `recommend_cursor_rules` function.
    *   **Rule Recommendation:** Calls `recommend_cursor_rules` with the repository summary to get a list of recommended cursor rules.
    *   **Rule Processing:** Categorizes, prioritizes, and filters the recommended rules. It also attempts to identify dependencies between the rules.
    *   **State Update:** Updates the `workflow_state` with the recommended, categorized, and selected rules. Marks `phase_2_complete` as `True`.

5.  **`execute_phase_3` (Workspace Preparation):**
    *   **Prerequisites Check:** Checks if Phase 2 is complete.
    *   **Rule Name Processing:** Extracts rule names from the selected rules, makes them filename-safe, and ensures uniqueness.
    *   **Tool Execution:**
        *   Calls `ensure_makefile_task()` to ensure the Makefile has the `update-cursor-rules` task.
        *   Calls `update_dockerignore()` to exclude the cursor rules drafts directory from Docker builds.
        *   Calls `create_cursor_rule_files()` to create empty `.mdc.md` files for each rule in the `hack/drafts/cursor_rules` directory.
    *   **State Update:**  Updates the `workflow_state` with the rule file names and marks `phase_3_complete` as `True`.

6.  **`execute_phase_4` (Rule Creation):**
    *   **Prerequisites Check:** Checks if Phase 3 is complete.
    *   **Rule Processing:** Iterates through the rule file names and:
        *   Extracts rule metadata (description, file patterns, content patterns, etc.) from `rule_file_mapping`.
        *   Calls `generate_cursor_rule()` to generate the content of the cursor rule in Markdown format.
        *   Calls `save_cursor_rule()` to save the generated content to a `.mdc.md` file in the `hack/drafts/cursor_rules` directory.
    *   **State Update:** Updates the `workflow_state` with the created rules and any errors that occurred during rule creation. Marks `phase_4_complete` as `True` if any rules were successfully created.

7.  **`execute_phase_5` (Deployment and Testing):**
    *   **Prerequisites Check:** Checks if Phase 4 is complete.
    *   **Deployment:** Calls `run_update_cursor_rules()` to execute the `update-cursor-rules` task in the Makefile, which copies the cursor rule files to the `.cursor/rules` directory.
    *   **State Update:** Updates the `workflow_state` with the deployed rules and marks `phase_5_complete` as `True`.
    *   **Testing Instructions:** Provides instructions for testing the deployed cursor rules.

8.  **Return Value:**
    *   Each `execute_phase_X` function returns a dictionary containing the status of the phase, a message, a checklist of completed tasks, relevant data (created rules, errors, etc.), the updated `workflow_state`, the `next_phase` to execute, and any `next_steps` for the user. The `plan_and_execute_prompt_library_workflow` tool returns this dictionary to the caller.

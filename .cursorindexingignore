# cursorindexingignore: Controls only which files are indexed for search and context (same as the old .cursorignore)

# The .cursorindexingignore file only controls which files are indexed for search and context features. This provides the same indexing control as the old .cursorignore. Use this file when you want to:

# Exclude large generated files from indexing
# Skip indexing of binary files
# Control which parts of your codebase are searchable
# Optimize indexing performance
# Important: Files in .cursorindexingignore can still be manually included as context or accessed by AI features - they just won't be automatically indexed or included in search results.

# ----------------------------------
# Templates - accessible but not indexed
.cursor/templates/
# NOTE:  I have updated the repo to properly add .cursor/rules/* to the .cursorindexingignore - without this, you will run into a lot of flakiness when trying to edit or tweak an existing rule or change its type without reindexing the whole project. This will make A BIG difference.
